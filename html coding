                <h3><br>An office automation system is the tool that enables data to move from
                     one system to another on its own without human intervention and inaccuracies.
                      These tools help organization collect, manage, and analyze securely to accomplish
                       everyday tasks and processes</h3>
                       <h3><br>Typical examples of functions performed by an OAS include printing documents, mailing
                            paperwork, mailing, maintaining a company calendar, and producing reports. Primarily,
                             an office automation system assists in enhancing communication among different
                              departments so everyone can collaborate to complete a task.</h3>

                    <h2>Purpose Of Office Automation System</h2>
                    <h3><br>In today’s digital age, office automation systems offer an array of benefits for
                         organizations of every size. Powerful office automation systems reduce manual effort
                          and store a large amount of data in little space. They not only streamline day-to-day
                           tasks but also speed up information retrieval. Additionally, these tools improve
                            process visibility and help businesses spot bottlenecks easily. On the other hand,
                             you could be watching data flow around on its own – that’s automation.

                        <h2><br>1. Easy workflow designer</h2>
                        <h3><br>Creating workflows used to be the domain of hard-core
                             system coders. So, as workflow software evolved, it
                              assumed the people using it would be programmers as
                               well.</h3>
                               <h3><br>However, a modern office automation system should
                                    start with the business user in mind, not the coder.</h3>
                                    <h3><br>When you sit down to trial an office automation tool,
                                         start off by making your own workflows. How easy is 
                                         it? Can you intuitively create the sequence of tasks 
                                         needed to finish a process? If you can’t figure it out
                                          within the first five minutes, you need to move on to the 
                                          next option.</h3>
                                          <h3><br>A piece of software shouldn’t determine how your business
                                               should set its operations. It should instead aid your teams
                                                to strengthen the existing processes.</h3>

                                  should work just as smoothly on someone’s phone while on a trip to China as it does on a PC
